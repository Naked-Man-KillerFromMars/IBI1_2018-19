Reflection on IBI Practical 12
I think it is not easy, we used Numpy and matplotlib that we never used before.
It is not hard either, the first two models can be figured out if careful enough. The third model also can be figured out with Melanie's guidance.
When coding the first two models, I did'nt know how to label the lines and couldn't plot the lines with different colors(in task 2).
I searched for many online resources to get one solution to label the lines. I tried out different ways and when I multiply 30 to "i" in the code "color=cm.viridis(30)", there came beatifully colored lines in my plot.
What I enjoy the most is successfully output the perfect plots.
The most important thing I learned is to try many times and trust myself. Keep trying and keep searching for solutions would lead me to success.
