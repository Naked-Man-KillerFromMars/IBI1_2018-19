 # This is your formative feedback for the IBI1 portfolio.


## Please do the following:

- [ ] Add this file to your GitHub fork of IBI1_2018-19. You are allowed to delete the last line (giving your score) before uploading the file to GitHub, if you do not want others to see it. 
- [ ] Make changes to your code from weeks 3 to 5 according to the feedback below. This will form part of your summative assessment. (You may use the checkboxes to keep track of your progress) 


## Feedback:

### Feedback Week 3:

- [ ] The site http://nakedmankiller-frommars.github.io/ does not exist â€?make sure the name of the repository for your website is exactly right








- [ ] The course staff will not tolerate abusive or threatening language directed at other students. 

- [ ] In your folder for Practical 3, there should be a file called Reflection.txt, which contains reflections on how the practical went, what you learned, and what questions you have.







### Feedback Week 4:




- [ ] In file variables.py, you should define Boolean variables W and Z as described in the practical instructions. It also makes sense to define X and Y as Booleans witha  fixed truth value (e.g. X=True), instead of making them dependent on other variables in yor script.



- [ ] File collatz.py seems to work fine, but you should use pseudocode to plan and document your work


- [ ] The mystery code outputs only one number, so it cannot print the prime numbers from 1 to 100. Be a bit more precise in describing what it does.



 




### Feedback Week 5:


- [ ] The code for counting nucleotides should ask the user to input a nucleotide sequence, instead of hard-coding it in the script.

- [ ] The code for counting nucleotides seems to count correctly and displays a pie chart, but it is inexplicably waiting for user input before displaying the pie chart. The code also brings up the following error: "TypeError: 'str' object is not callable"

- [ ] The bit that reverses a string does not run when the Practical5.py file is run, maybe because the first part of the file brings up an error message. A good solution would be to have both parts of the week 5 practical in different files: one for the nucleotide counting, one for string reversal and sorting.
- [ ] In the string reversal and sorting exercise, you should ask the user for input, instead of hard-coding it in the script.

- [ ] The reversal of words works fine, but the example given asks you to sort them reversely, i.e. going from the end to the start of the alphabet. 






This asssesment is formative and does not form part of your final grade. 

If this was a summative assessment, you would have scored 63 out of 100
